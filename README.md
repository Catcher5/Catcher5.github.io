### Blockquotes

> "His words seemed to have struck some deep chord in his own nature. Had he spoken
> of himself, of himself as he was or wished to be? Stephen watched his face for some
> moments in silence. A cold sadness was there. He had spoken of himself, of his own
> loneliness which he feared."

1. Crack three eggs over a bowl.

    Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.

    If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!
    
2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.

    Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!

3. Rub the salmon vigorously with butter.

    By "vigorous," we mean a strictly vertical motion. Julia Child once quipped:
    > Up and down and all around, that's how butter on salmon goes.
4. Drop the salmon into the egg-milk bowl.
    
    Here are some techniques on salmon-dropping:

    * Make sure no trout or children are present
    * Use both hands
    * Always have a towel nearby in case of messes
